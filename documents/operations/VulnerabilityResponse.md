# Rustynet Vulnerability Response Workflow

## Intake
1. Collect reports from internal testing, advisories, and disclosure channels.
2. Assign severity (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`) and affected components.
3. Open a tracked incident record with owner, discovery time, and patch target.

## SLA Enforcement
- `critical`: mitigation or patched build within 48 hours.
- `high`: patched build within 7 calendar days.
- `medium`: patched build within 30 calendar days.
- `low`: remediation planned in regular hardening cycle.

## Execution
1. Reproduce and scope impact.
2. Add regression tests before patching.
3. Patch root cause and rerun security/phase gates.
4. Prepare emergency release if severity is `critical` or active exploitation exists.

## Disclosure
1. Publish advisory summary with affected versions and upgrade guidance.
2. Record remediation and verification evidence in release artifacts.
3. Update patch-SLA tracker in `artifacts/security/patch_sla_tracker.json`.

## Staged Release Tracks
1. Promote to `unstable`.
2. Promote to `canary` after canary verification.
3. Promote to `stable` only after all security gates pass.
